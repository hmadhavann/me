        <h2>Reading</h2>
        <p class="center-hobbies">I have always loved reading, I read pretty much any genre, 
            and I have also been reading a lot more nonfiction lately</p>
        <h2>Piano</h2>
        <p class="center-hobbies" >I used to have a love-hate relationship with piano. 
            However, I have found myself missing it lately, 
            hence me taking classes last year. While, I am not this year,
            I do hope to learn some songs during my free time.
        </p>
