        <h2>Reading</h2>
        <p>I have always loved reading, I read pretty much any genre, 
            and I have also been reading a lot more nonfiction lately</p>
        <h2>Piano</h2>
        <p>I used to have a love-hate relationship with piano. 
            However, I have found myself missing it lately, 
            hence me taking classes last year. While, I am not this year,
            I do hope to learn some songs during my free time.

        <h2>Listening to Music</h2>
        <p>I love listening to music, I listen to pretty much any genre
            (besides country)
        </p>
        <h2>Learning Languages</h2>
        <p>While I don't always have the time, I enjoy dabbling in 
            different languages. Currently my goals are to learn french and hindi.
