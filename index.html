    <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>My name is Hima and I am junior and Lewis University! 
            I am a CS major and a History minor. 
            Currently, I am also thinking of adding a concentration in Data Analyitcs.
            At home, I live with my parents and my dog. 
            My dog is a terrier mix (we don't quite know his breed or his age)!
            His name is Sebastian, but we often call him Seban, Seb, or whatever Malayalam, Tamil, or Hindi
            nickname I fixate on at that moment.
